### Web Application for Bridging Communication Gaps Among NGOs, Volunteers, and Organizations

Developed as part of a 24-hour hackathon for the NGO [Way for Life](wayforlife.org), this MERN stack project aims to bridge the communication gap among non-governmental organizations (NGOs), volunteers, and organizations by providing a user-friendly platform equipped with personalized dashboards for each user.

Volunteers can easily browse through a variety of opportunities offered by NGOs and organizations, allowing them to select projects that resonate with their skills and passions. The platform enables volunteers to filter available work based on their priorities and availability, ensuring a tailored experience that maximizes engagement and satisfaction.

Additionally, organizations can manage their projects efficiently, track volunteer interests, and streamline communication, ultimately fostering a more collaborative and impactful environment. This application not only empowers volunteers to make a difference but also enhances the effectiveness of NGOs in mobilizing support for their causes.
